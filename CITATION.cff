  MSModel v1.0.0 - Program for solving multiple-scattering
  problems


  This program, written in C and based on LAPACK, solves the
  Foldy-Lax multiple-scattering equations of a scalar wave
  in a random point field to determine many physical
  quantities. In particular, it can be used to find the wave
  function and its intensity, the differential cross section
  of the point field, and the distribution of resonance
  poles in the complex plane of the wavenumber. The program
  uses multi-threading with OpenMP to accelerate the
  averaging of these quantities over the random
  configurations of the point field.


  Note on v1.0.0 : Original version of the MSModel program
  in its final state after David Gaspard's PhD thesis
  defended in June 2022.
